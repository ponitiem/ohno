a python program to replace the tabstop and shiftwidth in your .vimrc with random prime numbers every 2 to 10 minutes

---

**usage**
run the python file in the same directory as your vimrc. if it can't find tabstop or shiftwidth, it'll create it at the bottom of the vimrc file; otherwise, it'll just use the prexisting 'set tabstop/shiftwidth' commands.
